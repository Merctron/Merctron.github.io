# Teal

[Teal is a text adventure loader](https://github.com/Merctron/Teal) and associated web-app I built with help from [proof3](https://github.com/proof3). It's written in Rust which is overkill for a project this simple - the choice of programming language was simply to force myself to learn the language and have fun with it - the utility to run the loader can also be built as WASM and used within JavaScript apps. We've hosted [a simple app](https://proof3.github.io/Teal/) we built in this way to showcase text adventure we write ourselves.
