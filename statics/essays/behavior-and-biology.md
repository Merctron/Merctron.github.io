# Behavior And Biology

_This is a live document capturing notes and ideas about how biology drives behavior, borrowing heavily from Lectures by [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.robertsapolskyrocks.com/)_


## Introduction and the fallacy of categories

What determines the makeup, personality, and behavior of a human being is a fascinating question to ask. There is an interplay of environment, nurture, and the intracacies of biology and genetics that gives rise to individual humans and yet, Robert Sapolsky makes it a point to note that explanations have been made to dogmatically fit to categories. We therefore note at the outset some prominent categories (or my preferred term, lenses) under which we can think about the emergence of behavior and how these things interact with each other to create a cohesive whole:

* Behaviorism
* Evolutionary Biology
* Molecular Biology
* Behavioral Genetics

## Group Selection and Game Theory

### Group Selection

A common misconception when looking at the behavior of herd animals is mistaking an animal's sacrifice of their life to be for the good of the herd or species at large. This notion, known as group selection, has been falsified as a driver of behavior and generally we focus on only one incentive when it comes to all living beings - propagation of their genes.

### Game Theory

Situations of organism survival can often be modeled in terms of Game Theory - an organism completing for resources and/or involved in a prey-predator relationship in an ecosystem inevitably behaves in a way to reach a local Nash Equillibrium. Robert Sapolsky describes how biologists looked at developments in game theory and reasoned that game theoretic behaviors might be encoded genetically; he notes a set of successful strategies that we can discover:

* Tit-for-tat
* Forgiving Tit-for-tat
