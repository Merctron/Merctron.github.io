# Behavior And Biology

_This is a live document capturing notes and ideas about how biology drives behavior, borrowing heavily from Lectures by [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.robertsapolskyrocks.com/)_

## Introduction and the fallacy of categories

What determines the makeup, personality, and behavior of a human being is a fascinating question to ask. There is an interplay of environment, nurture, and the intracacies of biology and genetics that gives rise to individual humans and yet, Robert Sapolsky makes it a point to note that explanations have been made to dogmatically fit to categories. We therefore note at the outset some prominent categories (or my preferred term, lenses) under which we can think about the emergence of behavior and how these things interact with each other to create a cohesive whole:

* Behaviorism
* Evolutionary Biology
* Molecular Biology
* Behavioral Genetics

## Group Selection and Game Theory

### Group Selection

A common misconception when looking at the behavior of herd animals is mistaking an animal's sacrifice of their life to be for the good of the herd or species at large. This notion, known as group selection, has been falsified as a driver of behavior and generally we focus on only one incentive when it comes to all living beings - propagation of their genes.

### Game Theory

Situations of organism survival can often be modeled in terms of Game Theory - an organism completing for resources and/or involved in a prey-predator relationship in an ecosystem inevitably behaves in a way to reach a local Nash Equillibrium. Robert Sapolsky describes how biologists looked at developments in game theory and reasoned that game theoretic behaviors might be encoded genetically; he notes a set of successful strategies that we can discover:

* Tit-for-tat: Essentially, respond in kind - one good turn deserves another and so does a bad one.
* Forgiving Tit-for-tat: For the most part, respond in kind - although occasionally forgive a trangression because cooperation is more conducive to reproductive success and survival long term.

## Molecular Biology

Behavior and its underlying biology was long theorized to be driven by evolution but the first explanations were constructed on the basis of empirical observations and accompanying theories with good explanatory and predictive power. Later, molecular biology started describing the mechanisms.

### The Central Dogma of Biology

The starting point for molecular biology explanations was the central dogma of biology, mainly, that genetic information flow from DNA to RNA to finally protiens that drive the characteristics of an organism and how it functions. DNA was the starting point under this lense.

### Gradualism

Taking the Central Dogma to be axiomatic, evolution was thought to occur gradually -  a consequence of point mutations in the genetic code at various sections of DNA. Since DNA was thought to be foundational in driving information flow and the makeup of organisms, this gradual change in DNA over time was thought to be the driving force behind evolution. This school of thought also had a political and ideological force behind it - gradualism lends itself nicely to ideas of tiny advantages accumulating and proving that biology and life at large is locked in a competitive battle. Proponents of this could naturally draw comparisons to human society and claim capitlism is inevitable as the system of choice to structure of human affairs since it derives from how life operates from its very foundations.

### Exons, Introns, and Protien Networks

Over time we discovered that DNA is not as straightforward as translating a gene into RNA that translates into a protein. Sections that code for RNA are far and few in between and the rest of the space is taken up by exons. But what are exons? - they are switches turning networks of proteins on and off to allow different protein complexes to emerge.

In addition, these protien complexes can be activated in a variety of ways - broadly the environment an organism inhabits.

### Punctuated Equilibrium 

The existence of exons also had implications for the dominant lense of Gradualism that was used to understand evolution and how molecular biology drives it. Exons, since they control the activation of protein networks, have the potentials to create large change in an organism if they mutate. DNA is coded with redundencies to avoid this but the right type of mutations would imply explosive, and relatively rapid change in an organism in contrast to the slow, and deliberate change suggested by gradualism.
