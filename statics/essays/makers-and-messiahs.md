# Makers and Messiahs

This is a collection of my favorite quotes, and concepts from the Dune Science Fiction series by Frank Herbert. Why write this? Simply, I have found that writing about work I have enjoyed helps me think through it better and I like the idea of coming back to my favorite bits of the book in the form of a list I have curated for myself.

## Worship With Care

> *If you need something to worship, then worship life — all life, every last crawling bit of it! We're all in this beauty together! - Muad'Dib*

> *Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, 'I am not the kind of person I want to be.' It must never sink into an assemblage of the self-satisfied - Appendix, Dune*

> *No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero - Kynes*

Dune, at its core, is a warning against dogma, hero worship, and stagnation, and a call to build resillience as a people. We rightfully lionize those who lead, and those who build great audacious things, but we often forget to remember that admiration needs to be tempered with skepticism. Frank Herbet even makes this point in the voice of Paul Atredies, who having seen visions of the future is deeply cautious and cynical about the quasi-religious Jihad that is waged across humanity's space-bound dominion in his name:

> *Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man - Muad'Dib* 

Paul's son eventually embarks upon the Golden Path (that his father was not able to venture onto ) which among other things has as its goal to install the distate for Messiahs in a way that it is never forgotten. He becomes the ultimate tyrant, subjugating humanity for three millenia before his own prophesized death. On his goal, he says:

> *What am I eliminating? The bourgeois infatuation with peaceful conservation of the past. This is a binding force, a thing which holds humankind into one vulnerable unit in spite of illusionary separations across parsecs of space. If I can find the scattered bits, others can find them. When you are together, you can share a common catastrophe. You can be exterminated together. Thus, I demonstrate the terrible danger of a gliding, passionless mediocrity, a movement without ambitions or aims. I show you that entire civilizations can do this thing. I give you eons of life which slips gently toward death without fuss or stirring, without even asking 'Why?' I show you the false happiness and the shadow-catastrophe called Leto, the God Emperor. Now, will you learn the real happiness? - The Stolen Journals*

## Protect Access To Power

> *All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. - Chapterhouse Dune*

Corruption by a proximity to power is a well understood and oft repeated consquence bordering on Cliche. However, the importance of the consequence makes it worth repeating. Within Dune Messiah, Frank Herbet takes this idea further by exposing the decay of the entire religious-administriave apparatus that has assembled around Muad'Dib:

> *Every religious, business and governmental question has the single derivative: 'Who will exercise the power?' Alliances, combines, complexes, they all chase mirages unless they go for the power. All else is nonsense, as most thinking beings come to realize. - Dune Messiah*

## History Has Consequences

> *There is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors. - Muad'Dib*

There is a remarkable relevance to the above sentence. Without going into specifics, I have observed society try to continually shoulder the burden of past violence and it is a debt that cannot be paid back easily even when inheritors of violent history have a willingness to reconcile - nevermind those who want to continue to fight to correct the record.

## Economics And Spice

> *'Can you remember your first taste of spice?' 'It tasted like cinnamon.' 'But never twice the same,' he said. 'It’s like life—it presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable—slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized.' - Dune*

Spice serves multiple roles in the world of Dune - it is at various times: a psychedelic that unlocks religious and spirtiual experiences, an economic tool and currency made absolutely necessary for space travel because of its ability to grant prescience, and performance enhancing and life-extending drug. It being the centerpoint of all economic activity and interstellar trade also makes it serve as civilization's global shackle. Unable to create thinking machines and parallelized to take risks by the prescience that guides it through deep space, humanity stagnates in large part due to the Spice. This is why one of the objectives of Leto's Golden Path is bio-engineering his species to avoid prescience altogether.
