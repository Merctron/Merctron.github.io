# Reputation and Power

_This is a live document capturing notes and ideas about how regulatory state actors derive power and establish their reputation with an emphasis on the FDA, based on [the book by Daniel Carpenter](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691141800/reputation-and-power)_

## What powers do regulatory state actors have?

1. The ability to establish and work off a reputation in the public sphere.
2. The ability to shape public opinion, including but not limited to the power to define the parameters of a public debate, influence what science, and methods of experimentation are valid.
3. The ability to enforce the weight of federal statues. In case of the FDA, this is particularly pronounced because the organization has the power to admit or deny entry to drug manufacturers into the US market.
