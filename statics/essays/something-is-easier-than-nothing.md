# Something Is Easier Than Nothing (And Other Bold Ideas)

This began as a book review of a self help book I read for the express purpose of getting angry and being able to troll a friend - the book in question, [10x is easier than 2x](https://10xeasierbook.com/), turned out to actually not be that bad (by the standards of self-help books at least), so I turned this instead into an essay of sorts that discusses my thoughts on self-help using excerpts from the chapters of this book.

## Part 1 - Shallow Profundity

Self-help is a noble enough term. Dedicating your life to creating artifacts that geniunely help people seems like a good use of time if it worked. However, my life long experience with books and media that are tagged with this label have turned me into a bit of a skeptic.

I suppose part of the reason for this skepticism is that any useful advice I've read that was worth applying in my own life has come from people who were successful in life in some complicated set of endeavours (usually wholly unrelated to offering people advice on how to succeed) who later wrote down their thoughts to help people - writing self-help advice or coaching was not their primary vocation.

The other is that the history of the pioneers of the modern self-help genre is littered with fraud (I'd like to turn your attention to the enterprising [Napolean Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Hill) for starters).

Finally, it's that self-help books are rife with muddled semantics and adopt profundity as a pose (though sometimes this pose is sincere). I think sincerity is present when the 10x is easier than 2x author, Benjamin Hardy says:

> Operating non-linearly based on past assumptions and norms: 2x. Operating non-linearly based on an exciting and seemingly impossible vision: 10x.

Forgiving that both 10x and 2x are linear growth rates, one does get his point - he is communicating that 10x is a stand-in for a way of doing things that will drive better results in the following ways (my tl;dr of his book):

1. One must focus on what is most important and set goals to that effect.
2. Skill and identity are fluid. A continuous application of the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) to refine areas of focus, and adaptation to fulfill new, more ambitious roles in your personal and professional life is required.
3. Beating yourself up for past failures is not productive - frame results (and set future goals) using your past and present selves as reference points.
4. Avoid burnout, don't micro-manage, and build teams of smart people that self organize.
5. If you are an entrepreneur, create a fly-wheel of self managing teams that are composed of individuals that themselves apply the aforementioned principles.

There's a lot more examples and other content in the book - everything from a narrative about how Michaelangelo was a 10xing scultpor, a reference to Steve Jobs' clarity on focus (not extolling the virtues of mighty Steve is a cardinal sin for most entrepreneurial self-help books), to a description of how the YouTuber MrBeast is a paragon of the 10x focus on quality over quantity (I don't share the author's high opinion of MrBeast's content. Though I've read he does have a manical focus but [on what makes a good 'YouTube' video](https://kevinmunger.substack.com/p/in-the-belly-of-the-mrbeast) which I suppose is its own kind of quality?).

Hardy is forthcoming about his book being for 'high-level' entrepreneurs, even going so far as to say that what he calls the 10x mentality is not for everyone, and that being 2x is certainly a fine way to live.

> One friend, a relatively small entrepreneur, mentor, and dear friend of mine, told me that he loved the concepts but ultimately, he didn’t believe the book was for him. “I’m not looking for the level of transformation and commitment you’re describing in this book, Ben. I guess I prefer 2x over 10x as a way of life.” I saluted this dear friend of mine, agreeing that this book is not for everyone. And that’s completely fine. 10x as a way of life may not be for you. If you’ve made it this far into this book, you’re probably clear whether 10x is for you.

Kind sentiments, but hard to take seriously when the author in other places confers this type of weight to being 10x:

> As you go 10x, the quality and value of your time will expand, as will the quality and value of your money and how you get paid, as will the quality and value of those you spend time and work with, and finally the quality and value of your overall purpose and mission in life.

> 10x is playing the infinite game of expanding your freedom.

The implication is clear - why the fuck would you want to live a 2x life? Any advice, useful as it may be, is shrouded and cloaked in this type of framing. This is a typical tactic of self-help books - make the reader feel special that they are on the path to living life in a fundamentally profound way. That they are doing this already just by reading the book they are reading. That you dear reader, are not normal, but one of the special few because you have picked up this book that in the same breath compares the act of scaling up a real-estate business with the mastery required to sculpt the David, all while ostensibly offering the same advice about running a business or living your life that has been available for free since Marcus Aurelius wrote the Meditations.

## Part 2 - Deluded Focus and Uniqueness

Focus is a good thing. [Sometimes it is also divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Noetic_Sciences). As a eleven year old I read both [the Lost Symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Symbol) and [the Secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(Byrne_book)) and spent a good year and half believing my intense focus on getting a Gameboy was what had helped me manifest it in my life. Later, I realized that my focus on getting it had simply changed my behavior (meaning that I annoyed my dad enough into purchasing one for me).

Hardy spends much of the introduction and his first two chapters on cultivating the importance of focus and refining goals into his reader's minds. He does not advocate for anything fantastical and his examples are even practical. Indeed, finding the most important and impactful stuff to focus on will be good for your life and your business. And eventually he says this:

> Seemingly impossible or massive goals are highly practical because they immediately separate what works from what won’t, illuminating the few paths that have the greatest efficacy. Small goals are unable to clarify effective pathways because they are too marginal or linear from your current location.

Yes, one should set ambitious goals. Yes, difficult problems help you focus on contraints (I can't help but think some of this is a flowery restatement of [constraint theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints)). But classifying small goals as merely '2x' does them a disservice and leaves no room for nuance. Often, achieving a difficult objective involves breaking a difficult task into sub-problems or making incremental progress over long durations. I'm being pendantic of course (I imagine Hardy is focused on a narrow strain of business goal setting - in these settings, clarity of focus is more of an issue), though self-help as a genre and entrepreneurship as a meta-profession is littered with with advice that can sometimes [fold into delusion like with the founder of a certain health diagnostics company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos).

Ironically, my critique does not have much focus in this section - I've drawn a line from Hardy's book to the worst excesses created by business operators in the name of the focus on their so called vision. To conclude, you will be OK if you follow the good aspects of the 10x approach, temper your ambition, and refine your focus with humility about the complexity of the goal you are trying to achieve.

Hardy is also adamant that one should cultivate unique abilities by focusing on the 20% of their skill-set that drives most results. He is a fan of specialization, providing illustrative examples such as:

> Chelsea’s 80 percent revolved around organizational development and the follow-up and completion of big projects. Her superpower 20 percent was in supporting and keeping me organized, as well as supporting the team when they were executing big projects. Chelsea then went out and found Kaytlin, an unbelievably talented person to take over her old 80 percent. Kaytlin loves organizing systems and processes. She’s also extremely high in her follow-through and completion of big tasks and projects. She loves solving problems and getting things done. Now that Kaytlin is around, Chelsea’s job is 10x more enjoyable and she’s 10x better and more focused on the few areas she loves.

The unique super powers Hardy describes seem to be the same as the vague performance evaluations I have read and written about myself and others over the years. A high level of competence does not need to be dressed up or be singularly unique - it is already impressive. And sometimes uniqueness runs counter to focus because having a unique skill-set results from a varied, meandering, and markedly unfocused background and set of interests. I'm being overly harsh once again - Hardy is talking about focus and uniqueness within the confines of a single business so his advice does apply.

## Part 3 - Pat Yourself on the Back

Various traditions since antiquity have laid out how to be happy and not beat yourself up. The 10x approach to this focuses specifically on the [framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)) of personal and professional accomplishments (I imagine this is essential for business operators based on Hardy's experience coaching them). Hardy explains the tendency of people to belittle their own accomplishments by describing what he calls 'the Gap':

> The gap is a lens by which you measure what is against what could be. In the gap, you’re measuring what is against what you believe should be. When you’re in the gap, you’re measuring yourself or your situation against an ideal. This happens so much that it’s the conventional mode of operating for most people.

He contrasts this with 'the Gain', a way of benchmarking yourself against past versions of yourself and being grateful ([there's a reason so many people find it helpful to keep gratitude journals afterall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal)). He shows the power of this framing and in-the-gain thinking via examples such as:

> When you went from crawling to walking, you went 10x. You committed and transformed yourself. You can look back and see that at one point, you weren’t able to do something and then you made the transformation. When you learned how to speak, you went 10x. When you learned how to read, you went 10x. When you learned how to make friends, you went 10x.

Thanks Hardy. I feel pretty good about myself now.

## Part 4 - Live and Act in Kairos Time

Take a lot of vacations so you not only avoid burnout, but recharge for optimal performance. Work hard yourself, then hire smart people who like doing the things you don't like doing, and later let these smart people run your entire business so you can do even more focused cool stuff. Make sure you reward these smart people, and know that there is a risk inherent in operating this way because the smartest, best-performing people are the most in demand and will flee to greener pastures if you don't value them and give them autonomy.

All good advice (if somewhat obivious). All applicable to varying degrees (but mostly when you are already a very succesful business owner or leader). All of it 10x. According to Hardy, what makes it possible to live this way is the notion of 'Kairos Time':

> Kairos is an ancient Greek word meaning the right or opportune moment. Kairos is what many philosophers and mystics would refer to as “deep time” or “alive time.” In kairos-time, the world seems to stop entirely. It can be measured in long exhales, a shared laugh, a colorful sunset, a courageous moment. It is qualitative time where you move forward in the present, untethered by any moving clock or calendar.

We are back to theatrics intermingling with practical advice (references to [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/) also abound). Living a good life is to a large extent simple and composed of simple wisdoms one accumulates as they age so it bothers me when self-help authors dress it up as something profound. Life is already profound. I don't need a book talking about performance coaching for running a business to also tell me that applying these principles will help me metaphorically stop the flow of time in my life. I can already do that using edibles.

I did appreciate Hardy's advice about growing capable people in later chapters that describe how building great teams results in Kairos time for their leaders. He quotes his mentor Dan Sullivan (a name that comes up a lot throughout the book by the way):

> The corporate, bureaucratic attitude is that everybody is replaceable, and you never want to become dependent on people. But the only way you can actually make an extraordinary organization, that in fact you’ve grown people’s Unique Ability to such extent that they virtually are irreplicable.

This is not advice usually offered and is in stark contrast to the playbook used in most corporate environments where employees are seen as fungible entities - because most of the time they are. A deep focus on the uniqueness of individuals, especially within smaller high performance teams is a valid, and perhaps, the most successful approach but its application requires the right context. 

## Conclusion

I don't think I learned anything new while reading 10x is easier than 2x (And while remembering all the other self-help books I've read) but reading mostly sensible advice about focus, framing, burnout, and building teams, was good as a reminder. Repitition does have value after all but it affords progress that is most decidedly incremental. Then again, I'm not Benjamin Hardy bootstrapping his family:

> Yes, in 2018, we technically went from zero to five kids. 10x transformation.

10x is a sticky term and a useful way to package certain practices that will yeild results in the right context, but it has been used to sell all kinds of [nebulous success formulas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM2W_6clnpo). It seems to have the same tautological import as "The Law of Attraction", and "The Power of Positive Thinking". It can mean anything, even conjuring psychic vibrations to counter-balance the negativity of the normies:

> One person living and vibrating to the energy of optimism and a willingness to be nonjudgmental of others (310) will counterbalance the negativity of 90,000 people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels. One person living and vibrating to the energy of pure love and reverence for all of life (500) will counterbalance the negativity of 750,000 people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels. One person living and vibrating to the energy of illumination, bliss, and infinite peace (600) will counterbalance the negativity of 10 million people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels. One person living and vibrating to the energy of grace, pure spirit beyond body, in a world of nonduality or complete oneness (700–1,000), will counterbalance the negativity of 70 million people who calibrate at the lower weakening levels.

The author quotes this from a book called [Power versus Force by a certain Dr. Hawkins](https://veritaspub.com/) and then conveniently notes that:

> Whether Dr. Hawkins' exact measurements are correct is less important than the central message he's conveying, as well as the central message of this book.

I did hope that the book's mostly practical advice does not devolve into this but combining crunchy spirituality with practices that metricize success is a well known self-help calling card (this comes full circle when the author recounts how his advice helped 10x the baptisms at his Church). I will end by noting that my growth after reading this book has been as exponential as 10x is non-linear.
